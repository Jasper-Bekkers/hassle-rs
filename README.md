This crate provides an FFI layer and idiomatic rust wrappers for the new [DirectXShaderCompiler](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler) library.

- [Documentation](https://docs.rs/hassle-rs)

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
hassle-rs = "0.3.0"
```

and add this to your crate root:

```rust
extern crate hassle_rs;
```

Then acquire `dxcompiler.dll` on Windows or `libdxcompiler.so` on Linux directly from [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/antiagainst/directxshadercompiler/branch/master/artifacts), or compile it from source according to the instructions in the [DirectXShaderCompiler](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler) GitHub repository and make sure it's in the executable environment.

DxcValidator also requires `dxil.dll` which can be grabbed from any recent Windows 10 SDK flight.
